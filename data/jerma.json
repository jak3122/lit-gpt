    "output": "so we can show art uh although like i could do it at the end of streams but the problem with doing it at the end of a stream is i am doing the thing that i deliberately removed like four or five months ago where we hang out and sit there for a half an hour 20 15 20 30 40 minutes and we do a post streamdown, and I got rid of that deliberately. So that's not going to happen.\n"

And Community Content Night had the videos, and it was like a big thing. It was like, oh, we're going to do the art, then we're going to do the videos, we're going to do the music.

And then in the corner for, like, you know, five to ten minutes is, or, like, big enough, obviously, the starting suit would be in the corner. Do that. Have it run during the starting suit screen. I think that makes sense too. He's flustered.\n"

    "output": "And ever since I've been getting these digestive problems and these fucking headaches. And I woke up today and I had one of these annoying headaches. And if I were to laugh really, really hard, like we did last week or whatever week before, I would have to turn the stream off in like 40 minutes. So I've got kind of an issue in my brain today, and I knew for a fact that it would be a bad idea.\n"

  },
  {
    "output": "And then there is, I don't, I can't stop laughing or I can't stop having a major reaction to like three to five straight minutes of video. And I like, I, do you remember last time I was dying last time? So I think it's going to be a little different. It killed me too. Yeah. And I'll be honest too. I I'd rather be in a better state on like an important, special, fun night like that.\n"

    "output": "I don't want to just be kind of like, Oh yeah, I feel like shit. Uh, let's do that thing that, you know, I've been looking forward to for months. No, no, fuck that. You know what I mean? And I know it's disappointing, but I think it'd be more fun that way. I don't want to just... I'd rather be able to enjoy it, right? But, so, here's the plan. We're going to do this today.\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "We're going to play Sim Casino. I'm not going to laugh, but I probably am. I will explain the tweet, by the way. A lot of people are confused by my last tweet. You know, one tweet a year, Andy. I will explain that because there's a lot of people saying, what is he even talking about? Who's he even talking to? Why is he saying this? Okay, let's explain that real quick.\n"

Whatever. That's not, you know what I mean?\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "So I must have opened it and didn't do anything and then just went, oh, I'll get to this later. And then a year plus later, I'm cleaning out these and I didn't remember that's what that did. I had no idea that's what that did. You know, like, I didn't remember that it fills in placeholder Latin. So I'm sitting here freaking out thinking, why did, why is this here? Why is this here?\n"

    "output": "Because think about that. If you have, if you don't remember that, if you have no idea why that's there, that somebody wrote Latin in your phone. Who? I didn't fucking do it. You think I don't know Latin? I was going line by line and I was translating it. And it was just, it was gibberish. I was like, what was I trying to even tell myself? Like, what am I doing? Did I do this like as a joke?\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "Like I was showing somebody like, hey, look, look at my like notes for a stream I'm thinking of. It's in Latin. But no. Yeah it was lorem ipsum. And it's just the default placeholder for a note take and you just delete it and do your own. But it was scary. I was actually kind of scared for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Yeah, it's just placeholder.\n"

Hey, like, Danny! Danny!\n"

Absolutely. I think the bubble...\n"

That's fine.\n"

Crease them nicely and firmly so simply because that comes up that comes up Alright, looking good so far.\n"

That's not that hard.\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "You gotta get them all ready. Can you even see what I'm doing? There we go. That's been folded. This has been folded. That's been done. Okay, now what's left? See how much easier it is if you crease all the fold lines at the beginning. Yeah, I mean, I guess. This part is called a tab. It will be very important to your building process. That's right here. Okay.\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "Carefully insert the tab into the opening to make sure it doesn't get bent out of shape. I'll get it. Hold on. Who says you need it? I got it. I got it. Don't worry.

I have... My nails are long. Holy shit.\n"

Like a TV show. I don't know.\n"
  },

    "output": "Sometimes I think about that, and I'm trying to gauge if that's a good idea for 2018. Is it live? Yeah, it would be live. Some portions might be put in, but it would be a live segment. It would be a live show. TV isn't live, though. But I mean, obviously, I'd be broadcasting whatever it was on Twitch. Do a German rumble where you get to vote who dies. That would be pretty brutal. Is this live?\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "I hope so. But combining the two platforms, I think, makes sense. And... Because I've moved exclusively pretty much yeah i mean i mean look there are there are like three or four videos that i have written out and they're done and they just need to be filmed uh two of which are going to be crazy and I can't wait until they're actually, truly, like, the set is built.\n"

I promise you that there will be at least a few occasions in 2018 where you will see that happen. You're going to see that. I got to get a Vive. No, don't worry. Hey, Vive streams are also coming too. Dreamcast.\n"

That should be just strange. I hope it is. I hope it's the weirdest fucking thing you've ever seen. Yeah, we're going to do a shitload of Dreamcast. We're going to do a bunch of, um... We're going to do a bunch of Vive.\n"

The numbers on the top and the left, this is how many squares you need to fill in in this column here. Same thing on this side.\n"

  },
  {
    "output": "We've logically deduced that this is the only one, so therefore it is now grayed out. Take a look over here. This says zero. As you are well aware, zero means none, so there are no squares to fill in here. Got it? So therefore, there are three that need to be filled in here. There's one here already, so guess what? One, two, three. That's where it goes. Notice how now we have our three.\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "We've deducted with our technological brains. Same thing here. See, one and one. You're probably asking, what the heck's going on with the two ones? Well, just relax. I'll tell you. This means that there is a space of at least one square between these two numbers. So, as you see, we have one here. So this is one of the ones. It's probably the second one.\n"
  },
  {
    "output": "Considering that this is already filled in, no more squares are allowed to be here. So our one, space one, there has to be at least one empty space. Same thing with this one. So you got one, one. Solved our first puzzle. Now I can bring the chat back up so you know. And that's F for the string, right? Everyone's going to say F, like rip string. Okay, so now I can bring the chat back.\n"

See, 3, 1.\n"

What's that? 0? 5? There's only three spaces left. So fill it in. Same thing with this one. Only three spaces left. Same with this one. Only three spaces left. The 1, 1, 1 up here is already done.

Therefore, deduce with your brains. One, two, three. That has to be three in a row. Bingo. Same thing over here, right? What's the deal with this one? Can you guys help? Can I get some help on this one? This one is the reverse of the other one.\n"

    "output": "The rest of the strap will now go through one of the zig-zaggy openings on the left-hand part. It should be the same one shown on screen. Okay, that one. Through there and then around to the... okay. This way. God, they make this so difficult. That's it. Finally tighten the strap by pulling on it. Now that's what it's supposed to look like. I mean mine doesn't really look like that.\n"

Because people just need to be so good and need to care i have to be so good\n"

I think that's a mistake. I think that competitive...\n"

And then it's almost like they take that by osmosis. What you say? I'm top 50 in the world. Overwatch made me lose a lot of friends. But that's not what this whole space should be about. It shouldn't be about losing your fucking friends.\n"
  },

    "output": "Over something that's supposed to bring you all together. Not even close. But. But, we could talk about this for hours.

But, I think this space could do well as a whole if we just kind of dialed it back to the origins of why we're playing in the first place.\n"
